    <h3> The Origins</h3>
        <p> <font size ="3"> The genre of pop emerged in the 50s as a culmination of other popular music genres at the time, like rock 'n roll, bebop and jazz. Early pop stars such as Elvis Presley were pioneers of the genre by using fusions of blues, rock and country to create a distinct sound. This proved to be largely popular amongst the community as the genre grew in prominence and popularity over the next years with artists like Bill Haley, Carl Perkins, and Buddy Holly taking pop music to the next level. The reign of pop music continued into the 1960s with groups like the Beatles pushing the genre even further into the hearts of mainstream music. Since then, many well known pop singers dominated the world stage, with artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince exploding in popularity over the next few decades. </font> </p></div>

    <h3> The Instruments</h3>
        <p> <font size ="3"> In pop music, there is a standard lineup to give it a distinct sound. Some instruments that are typically used in Number 1 hits include drums, guitar bass, synthesizers, strings, vocals, and backing vocals. But, instruments used can change depending on the type of pop music. Some forms of pop music that are different from classic pop include Psychedelic Pop and Chamber Pop. Psychedelic pop, for instance, is a form of pop music in which its musical form is inspired by the use of hallucogenic drugs such as LSD. Psychedelic pop uses backwards and fuzz guitars, tape loops, unconventional keyboard effects, and sitars, with some famous examples including the Beatles' "I am the Walrus, or "deja vu" by Olivia Rodrigo. On the other hand, chamber pop is a subgenre of pop that includes elements used in orchestras and classical music, with prominent use of violins, cellos, and double basses. Some famous examples of chamber pop include the 1965 hit song "Yesterday", by the Beatles. Punk and Pop can also be fused to create the Pop Punk genre, which is popular for its heavy beat and emotionally driven lyrics, with songs such as "abcdefu" by Gayle. </font> </p></div>

        <h3> The Technical Elements</h3>
        <p> <font size ="3"> When it comes to the technical elements of pop, there are many features that shape its form and uniqueness. The average tempo of a pop song is between 100-130 bpm. In recent years, the average tempo of pop songs has been slowing down, with artists like Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish incorportating slow beats, with southern pop and trap influenced beats. However in the past year, the "happy" and "speedy" pop songs have made a comeback, with songs such as "Physical" by Dua Lipa. When it comes to time signature, pop songs also usually use a 4/4 time, as it allows a song to have more versatility when it comes to rhythm. As for the keys used, the most popular keys in pop are G Major and A Major. The reason why these keys are so popular music is because these keys are the easiest to play and are some of the most versatile keys in music. Additionally, their minor counterparts, which are A minor and E minor respectively, are excellent to use in songs with somber, less energetic songs. The dynamics of a pop song can vary depending on the genre. For instance, genres like power pop and punk pop have a louder, and faster beat which can be a driving force in the song, other genres such as chamber and psychedelic pop tend to sometimes be slower and richer in texture compared to the aforementioned power anbd punk pop genres.</font> </p>
