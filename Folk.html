    <h1> <center> Folk Music</center></h1>
    <h2> <center> Folk music is what shapes the identity of a country. Its related to national culture and is popular due to its influences being passed down through the generations. It is hard to overstate its importance.</center></h2>

    <div class="column">
    <h3> The Origins</h3>
        <p> <font size ="3"> Folk music originated in different ways depending on the area. For instance, in North America, European settles and African slaves brought their traditions forward to the Americas. Many of the songs that were sung on slave plantations were then a source of inspiration for some of the biggest hits in folk history. Even the song "East Virginia" has its roots in 17th century England. As for Jordan, my homeland, we have developed a rich and unique sound with our iconic instrument such as the reed pipe and Yarghul, thanks to the Bedouins that brought forward these instruments that shape our country's musical identity. Over the years, folk music has been passed through generations the way it is. Its authenticity is what makes it special.</font> </p></div>

    <h3> The Instruments</h3>
        <p> <font size ="3"> Folk music can vary a lot depending on the area of its origin. For example, in North America, folk music ussually comprises of harmonica, acoustic guitar, and a selection of classical stringed instruments such as the double bass. These instruments give folk music their "american" feel and are usually rooted in country sounds. As for my homeland, Jordan, there is a wide selection of instruments such as the previously mentioned Yarghul and reed pipe. But there are other instruments as well, like the oud, and bagpipes. These instruments together form a distinct sound that many identify as pure Jordanian folk music. There are also subgenres of folk music, such as folk rock, and roots rock. Folk rock incorporates popular rock elements within the folkier sounds, such as electric guitar, and drums, but still follows folkier chord progressions, and roots rock is largely 'rooted' in country and blues, which can also incorporate some elements of electric instruments and more melodic guitar riffs. Examples on American and Jordanian folk music include 'This Old Guitar' and 'Bein El-Dawali' respectively. Examples on folk rock include 'The Sounds of Silence' by Simon and Garfunkel, and 'Stairway to Heaven' by Led Zeppelin. An example on roots rock is 'One after 909' by the Beatles. > </p></div>

        <h3> The Technical Elements</h3>
        <p> <font size ="3"> The technical elements of folk music are quite generic and don't hold much uniqueness to them. The standard time signature of a folk song can be either 3/4 or 4/4 but there are some folk songs that can be written in time signatures such as 2/4. The steady time signatures give the song a lot of versatility in the rhythmic department. The average tempo of a folk song can range anywhere from 85-110 beats per minute, which gives the song a steady, moderately paced beat that is easy to groove along to. Folk songs tend to not go overboard when it comes to tempo as to keep the music authentic, coherent, and understandable, as it represents a rich part of a country's culture. And finally, the keys used for folk songs, they tend to use commonly used chord progressions such as C-F-G and Am-G. Additionally, folk songs mae use of an element called parallel modes to alter between the major and minor key of a certain note. That being said, folk songs tend to use 'natural' keys such as C, D, A, and F to give it a more folkier sounds. Sharp or flat keys such as F-sharp or A-flat will diminish the 'folky' sound in a song. Unlike other types of music, the dynamics of a folk song stay relatively the same. Folk music is usually slower-paced than other songs, and are very stripped down, to the point where you can basically hear every instrument on the track. They are often rich in texture and have soft, and smooth rhythms.</font> </p>
